	0. Can I color rows of the Table?
	1. see how reading in Excel file with multiple sheets works.
	2. Calculator becomes profile summary
	3. Slider must change table also so perhaps do in tabs.

	5. Name? IPD International $1 Billion Challenge 2014
	6. Accounts/passwords?

Columns on site table:
	YTD: OI, OP, Actual, Incremental (Add OI, erase %OP)
	HTD: OI, OP, Actual, %LG OP, %LG Actual, LCG% over OP

YTD:
	incremental/OP in Absolute $ ($)
	Coloring by: Incremental $$ over OP column.
		Top two are blue (2 winners in each)
		gradient green-yellow,
		disqualified are different gradient of red.

HTD:
	Delta % / OP in LC (%)


Column for Operational Income 2013 will be added because must be improved over that to be eligible. OP is the plan for OI 2014.
